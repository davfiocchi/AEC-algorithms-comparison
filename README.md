# AEC algorithms comparison
This was the final project for the course Model Identification and Adaptive Systems. 
Developed by me and @rtirene

### Briefly
This project was ment to compare the performance of the following adaptive algorithms:
- LMS
- NLMS
- APA
- RLS

You can find a more in-depth description of the theoretical background, experiments and results in the [report](MIAS_AECprojectReport_Irene_Fiocchi.pdf)

We have used [this](https://www.iks.rwth-aachen.de/en/research/tools-downloads/databases/aachen-impulse-response-database/) database for the impulse responses.
